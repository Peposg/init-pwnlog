## My Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning repository! This is a personal log and knowledge base documenting my journey from the very foundations of computer science and IT to advanced cybersecurity topics with a focus on ethical hacking.

## Learning Path

My learning journey is structured into clear phases:

1. **Computer Science Foundations**
   Basics of programming, data structures, algorithms, operating systems, and computer networks.

2. **IT Fundamentals**
   Hardware, software, networking, system administration, virtualization, and scripting essentials.

3. **Cybersecurity Fundamentals** 
   Core security concepts, threat modeling, cryptography, risk management, blue team practices, and more.

4. **Ethical Hacking Specialization** 
   Focused hands-on practice with penetration testing, red teaming, bug bounty methodologies, tools (e.g., Burp Suite, Metasploit), and certifications (e.g., CEH, OSCP prep).

## Documentation Style

I document each topic I study with:
- Notes and summaries in Markdown
- Code snippets and scripts
- Tool usage and labs walkthroughs
- Practice exercises and CTF writeups
- Key takeaways and reflection logs

## Timeline

This is a long-term learning roadmap. I’ll be updating regularly with new content, personal projects, and learning milestones.
